We focus on data challenges in computational epigenomics, including data harmonization, data integration
and functional annotation. Two main research areas are focused in the lab.

#### Integrative Epigenomics 

With genomics dataset accumulated, opportunities emerge to better interpret gene 
regulation using integrative approaches. Currently, a variety of technologies dedicate
to understand gene regulation: ChIP-seq, Cut&Tag, ATAC-seq, HiC, HiChIP, RNA-seq and CRISPR screens etc. 
We develop compuatational methods to process and understand these datasets.
 - Harmonizing ChIP-seq datasets across large spectrum of biological conditions. One barrier
   to jointly interpret ChIP-seq is the [data  heterogeneity] (https://doi.org/10.1093/nargab/lqab098) 
   that raise from diverse experimental parameters by different studies. For example,
   different ChIP-seq samples might be tolerant to different levels of PCR artifacts that could
   be asscociated to the [GC content of sequencing fragments](https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.220673.117).
   We have developed statistical models to diconvolute such data heterogeneity and better interpret
   ChIP-seq signals.

#### Oncovirus Genomics

Oncovirus is another main biological setting where we build our 
analyzing techniques. The goal is to discover novel biomarkers during viral
oncogenesis, such as the critical viral targets in cancer hallmark pathways,
functions of virus oncoproteins, etc. The studied oncoviruses include EBV 
(gastric and nasopharyngeal cancers), HPV (cervical and head & neck cancers), 
KSHV (Kaposi sarcoma), HIV etc.
