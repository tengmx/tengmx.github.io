Our research focuses on data science questions in decoding cancer
epigenomic mechanisms. Our approaches include novel methodology
developing, large data integration, and close wet-lab collaboration.
Main projects are listed below. <br>

#### Integrative Epigenomics 

Accumulated public datasets in epigenomics enable us to better
interpret gene regulation through integrative approaches. These
datasets include that measuring chromatin protein binding (ChIP-seq,
CUT&Tag, etc.), chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq, DNase-seq, etc.),
3D chromatin looping (HiC, HiChIP, etc.), sequence
editing/mutating in non-coding regions (CRISPR screens, target
sequencing etc.) and so on. Our lab develop computational methods
to integrate and interpret these datasets.

 - **Understanding enhancer function with multi-omics data
   integration**. Key questions to interpret enhancer function include
   who and how enhancers organize gene regulation. We integrate
   sequencing assays measuring enhancer acitivities, enhancer-protein
   binding, gene expression and enhaner-gene interactions to provide
   quantitative answers to the questions. With well-designed
   integrative approaches, we uncovered novel insights to understand [super
   enhancer internal organization](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkac141). 
   By integrating public datasets into in-house domain applications, we
   identified [critical enhancer
   regulators](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20136-w) in cancers.

- **Harmonizing epigenomic sequencing variabilities across wide
   biological conditions**. One barrier to efficient integrate
   epigenomic sequencing data is the data heterogeneities within one
   data modality and across multi-modalities. The heterogeneities
   raise from diverse biological and technical parameters in different
   studies. For example, ChIP-seq datasets are tolerant to high
   measuring variabilities due to [PCR induced GC content
   biases](https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.220673.117) or other [intrisic
   bias factors](https://doi.org/10.1093/nargab/lqab098). We develop
   statistical models to deconvolute such data heterogeneity and
   better interpret epigenomic sequencing signals.

#### Cancer Genomics

Cancers are the main biological setting where we apply our
computational techniques. Our recent works focus on understanding
oncogenesis mechanisms based on close collaboration
with web-lab colleagues. We study oncogenesis mechanisms triggered by
oncoviruses (e.g. Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) and human papillomavirus
(HPV) etc.) and clonal hematopoiesis. 

 - **Oncogenesis driven by viral-associated 3D chromatin
   looping**. One of our key hypotheses is that viruses alter the host
   genome 3D looping during oncogenesis. This provides us an
   unique angle to evaluate [key biomarkers in viral-triggered
   cancers](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-37347-6). We found that
   viruses may generate [critical super
   enhancers](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20136-w) 
   involving in re-organizing human genome expression. 

 - **Clonal hematopoiesis biomarkers across solid tumors**. Clonal
   hematopoiesis was found highly associated to reduced survival in
   cancer patients. The molecular mechanisms however are unclear. We work
   closely with the ORIEN network to decode relationships between
   cancers and clonal hematopoiesis, to understand the common and
   unique roles of clonal hematopoiesis.
