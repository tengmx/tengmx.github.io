We focus on computational/statistical methods to address data challenges
in genomic studies, such as data preprocessing, data integration
and functional annotation of high-throughput sequencing datasets. 
Research areas are included below.

#### Integrative Epigenomics 

We have been working on improving genomic data processing by collectively 
analyzing heterogeneous datasets using comparative modeling and integrative 
approaches. One main application is to better understand gene regulation 
through the improved analysis techniques, such as the regulatory mechanisms involving 
enhancers and super enhancers. Data types involved in these researches
include RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, Hi-C, HiChIP, CRISPR screen, CHIA-PET, WES, ATAC-seq etc.

#### Oncovirus Genomics

Oncovirus is another main biological setting for the applications of our 
analysis techniques. The goal is to discover novel biomarkers during viral
oncogenesis, such as the critical viral targets in cancer hallmark pathways,
functions of virus oncoproteins, etc. The studying oncoviruses include EBV 
(gastric and nasopharyngeal cancers), HPV (cervical and head & neck cancers), 
KSHV (Kaposi sarcoma), HIV etc.
