We focus on statistical/computational methods to address data challenges
in genomics studies, such as data preprocessing, data integration
and functional annotation of high-throughput genomic sequencing datasets. 
Ongoing research areas include:


<br>
#### Integrative Epigenomics 

We have been working on improving genomic data analysis by collectively 
analyzing datasets using either comparative modeling for large datasets
or integrative approaches across different genomic data types. One of 
our main focuses is to infer genetic regulatory mechanisms under cancer
settings, such as gene regulation by enhancers and super enhancers. 
Sequencing data types we currently work with towards this goal
include RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, HiC-seq, HiChIP, WES etc. 
 - ChIP-seq data harmonization
 - HiCHIP data processing
 - CHIP identification
 - ATAC-seq benchmarking

#### Oncovirus Genomics

We focus on oncoviruses as the main biological  applications of our data
analysis approaches. We aim to discover novel biomarkers during viral
oncogenesis, such as the critical viral targets in cancer hallmark pathways,
functions of virus oncoproteins, etc. The oncoviruses we currently 
work on include EBV (gastric and nasopharyngeal cancers), HPV
(cervical and head & neck cancers), KSHV (Kaposi sarcoma), HIV etc.
 - Epigenomic regulation in EBV+ NPC
 - Integrative genomics in HPV+ HNSCC
