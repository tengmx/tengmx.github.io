### Research Interests

We focus on statistical/computational methods to address data challenges
in cancer genomics studies, such as data preprocessing, data integration
and functional annotation of high-throughput genomic sequencing data. 
Areas of ongoing research include:


<br>
#### Integrative Genomics 

We have been working on improving genomic data analysis by collectively 
analyzing datasets using either comparative modeling for large datasets
or integrative approaches across different genomic data types. One of 
our main focuses is to infer genetic regulatory mechanisms under cancer
settings, such as gene regulation by enhancers and super enhancers. 
Sequencing data types we are currently working with towards this goal
including ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, HiC-seq, HiChIP, etc.

#### Oncovirus Genomics

We focus on oncoviruses as the main biological  applications of our data
analysis approaches. We aim to discover novel biomarkers during viral
oncogenesis, such as the critical viral targets in cancer hallmark pathways,
functions of virus oncoproteins, etc. The oncoviruses we are currently 
working on including EBV (in gastric and nasopharyngeal cancers), HPV
(in cervical and head & neck cancers), KSHV (Kaposi sarcoma).
