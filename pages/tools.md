[gcapc](https://bioconductor.org/packages/gcapc/).
An R/Bioconductor package for ChIP-seq peak calling with adjustment of
potential GC-content bias. GC bias is first estimated with generalized
linear mixture models using effective GC strategy, then applied into 
peak significance estimation. The package also provides option to remove
GC bias for a given list of genomic sites. Package is also available 
on [GitHub](https://github.com/tengmx/gcapc).

[ComplexDiff](https://github.com/tengmx/ComplexDiff).
An R-package to normalize and estimate differential DNA bindings
of protein complexes with ChIP-seq data.

[rnaseqcomp](https://bioconductor.org/packages/rnaseqcomp).
An R/Bioconductor pakcage providing several quantitative and visualized
benchmarks for RNA-seq quantification pipelines, accompanied with an
easy-to-use [web tool](http://rafalab.rc.fas.harvard.edu/rnaseqbenchmark).
Quantifications of genes, transcripts, junctions or exons in two compared
conditions by each pipeline with necessary meta information should be
organized into numeric matrices in order to proceed the evaluation.
Package is also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/tengmx/rnaseqcomp).

[regSNPs](https://github.com/tengmx/regSNPs).
R code pipeline that implements the strategy for prioritizing regulatory 
single nucleotide substitutions for a given phenotype.
