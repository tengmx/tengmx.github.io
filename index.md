### Research

I develop computational and statistical methods for genomics analysis.
Particularly, I focus on inferring genomics findings by pre-processing 
and analyzing of high-throughput sequencing data and by integrating and 
visualizing with public data resources. My lastest researches include 
[GC-content bias correction](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/12/01/090704)
for ChIP-seq and 
[benchmark](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-0940-1)
of quantification
pipelines for RNA-seq.


### Background

I received my BEng, MEng and PhD from 
[School of Computer Science and Technology](http://encs.hit.edu.cn/)
at Harbin Institute of Technology
under the direction of Prof. Yadong Wang. I was also a visiting student in the
[Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics](http://www.compbio.iupui.edu)
at Indiana University School of Medicine under the direction of Prof. Yunlong Liu
and Prof. Lang Li.
