### Research

I develop computational methods and tools  for genomics analysis.
Particularly, I focus on inferring genomics findings by pre-processing 
and analyzing of high-throughput sequencing data and by integrating and 
visualizing with public data resources. My latest researches include 
[GC bias correction](https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.220673.117)
for ChIP-seq data,
[statistical benchmarks](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-016-0940-1)
of quantification pipelines for RNA-seq data, and other collaborative works.


### Education

I received my BEng, MEng and PhD from School of Computer Science and Technology
at Harbin Institute of Technology under the direction of Prof. Yadong
Wang. My PhD works focused on computational analysis methods for
regulatory single nucleotide variants and DNA methylation fidelity, 
which were partially finished in Profs. Yunlong Liu and Lang Li 's labs
in the Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics at Indiana
University School of Medicine. I had my postdoctoral training in
Prof. Rafael Irizarry's lab in the Department of Biostatistics and 
Computational Biology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and
Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
