#### Research

I develop computational methods and tools to address data challenges 
in genomic studies. Particularly, I work on next generation sequencing
datasets with the focuses on data pre-processing, data mining and functional 
annotation, as well as data integration across a wide-range of sequencing
types. Another specific interest of me is to elucidate the mechanisms 
of viral oncogenesis in human cancers using integrative approaches.

#### Education

I received my BEng, MEng and PhD from School of Computer Science and Technology
at Harbin Institute of Technology under the direction of Prof. Yadong
Wang. My PhD works focused on computational analysis methods for
regulatory single nucleotide variants and DNA methylation fidelity, 
which were partially finished in Profs. Yunlong Liu and Lang Li 's labs
in the Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics at Indiana
University School of Medicine. I had my postdoctoral training in
Prof. Rafael Irizarry's lab in the Department of Biostatistics and 
Computational Biology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and
Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
