### Research

I develop computational and statistical methods for genomics analysis.
Particularly, I focus on inferring genomics findings by pre-processing 
and analyzing of high-throughput sequencing data and by integrating and 
visualizing with public data resources. My latest researches include 
[GC bias correction](https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.220673.117)
for ChIP-seq data,
[statistical benchmarks](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-016-0940-1)
of quantification pipelines for RNA-seq data, and other collaborative works.


### Education

I received my BEng, MEng and PhD from 
School of Computer Science and Technology
at Harbin Institute of Technology
under the direction of Prof. Yadong Wang. My PhD works focused on
computational analysis methods for 
regulatory single nucleotide variants
DNA methylation fidelity
I was also a visiting graduate student in the
Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics
at Indiana University School of Medicine under the direction of
Profs. Yunlong Liu and Lang Li.
